# MicroPython code example for an ESP32 board

I included multiple routes, serves HTML content, and adds a form for user input. 

Make sure you have the required libraries and MicroPython firmware installed on your ESP32 before running this code.

The index function serves an HTML page with a simple form that asks for the user's name. When the form is submitted, the submit function processes the form data and responds with a personalized message.

Just like before, replace "your_wifi_ssid" and "your_wifi_password" with your actual WiFi credentials.

Please ensure you have the microWebSrv.py file and the necessary dependencies properly set up for this code to work on your specific ESP32 board and MicroPython version.
